# My PyTorch Deep Learning Journey

This is my journey of getting started with PyTorch for deep learning.

I started with the course from FreeCodeCamp: [PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA) taught by Daniel Bourke and also went through resources posted by him at [Learn PyTorch](https://www.learnpytorch.io/00_pytorch_fundamentals/).

I will be documenting what worked for me and how far I was able to come in life.
